Utility companies, institutes or entities who own detailed geocoded datasets may wish to use their own data for creating a heat density map and use it for further studies both within and beyond the Hotmaps toolbox. Feature 63 aims to give such flexibility to the user for creating a bottom-up heat density map. 
Feature 63 of the Hotmaps toolbox has foreseen various combinations of detailed geocoded data for creating a heat density map. The user may choose one of the following combinations of data inputs depending on their availability:	

1. Building stock heat demand (kWh/year) and building stock coordinate, both provided in a comma separated value (.csv) file,
2.	Building stock heat demand (kWh/year) and building stock shapefile, both provided in a shapefile (.shp),
3.	Average specific heat demand of buildings (kWh/m2) for residential and commercial sectors and building stock gross floor area in shapefile,


In addition to a heat density map, the user would be able to get a summary of input data as well as calculated results in a csv file. Furthermore, it is also possible to see this summary in shapefile format for all the above-mentioned cases excluding case 1.
