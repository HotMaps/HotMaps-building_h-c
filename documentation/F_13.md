District heating can be an economic and ecologic alternative to supply the buildings heat demand for space heating and domestic hot water. Apart from considering the heat generation and the energy carrier mix used for it, the regional demand and its density are essential to guarantee economic viability. Therefore, this feature can be used in order to get first insights of district heating potentials. This is done via introducing two thresholds, namely a heat demand density threshold in the lowest available entity (here: 1ha areas) as well as an annual heat demand threshold for a group of neighboring entities (potential district heating region). The Hotmaps toolbox suggests the default values of 10 GWh/km2 and 30 GWh/year for these thresholds. However, the user has the possibility to modify these values. 
Feature 13 is designed to perform on local, regional, national and EU-28 level. The main input for running this feature is the heat density map of EU-28 countries. The user would be able to use an own developed heat density map as well; however, with similar specification as of default heat density map (resolution and coordinate reference system). The given thresholds are applied to the heat density map. The output is a raster layer that demonstrates the qualified district heating areas as well as their potential.
