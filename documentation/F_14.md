Feature 14 compares various supply options on building category level. Based on the buildings heat demand and the heat load, the Levelized cost of heat (â‚¬/kWh) and the corresponding specific CO2-emissions (kg/kWh) are calculated. Therefore, the user can insert his interest rate, the amortisation horizon, the heat demand and heat load. The calculation of the levelized cost of heat considers the energy costs, the operation and maintenance costs as well as the investment costs. The calculation of the energy costs requires the household energy prices for the energy carriers as well as assumptions regarding its development. Furthermore the efficiency of all heating systems is considered.
