The initial investment in the DH grid is usually associated with uncertainty regarding future heat sales and the potentially achievable connection rate of DH. This feature, enables the energy planners to study the DH grid investments from various perspectives such as grid cost ceiling , investment periods, DH market share and expected levels of the energy saving in future due to building retrofitting and renovation. In addition, the impact of these parameters on DH potential and connection of remote areas to the DH grid can be studied as well.
In this feature, the heat density map (HDM) and the plot ratio map from Hotmaps default data set (D2.2) are used for determining potential DH areas with specific focus on district heating (DH) grid costs. The DH areas are determined via performing sensitivity analyses on the HDM under consideration of predefined upper bound of the average distribution costs. Accordingly, the distribution grid investment is calculated per pixel of HDM as well as within each coherent area (set of connected pixels that constitute a potential DH region). The approach additionally allows for estimation of length, diameter and configuration of transmission lines and their associated costs. The outputs are GIS layers illustrate areas that are economically viable for construction of DH as well as the cost-minimal transmission lines connecting these regions to each other. Additional indicators are returned to the user for better understanding of the results.
