Heat density maps of EU-28 countries are provided as a default dataset of the Hotmaps toolbox. These maps depict the demand distribution with a 1ha resolution and can be used to calculate the heat demand in a desired region. For specific planning purposes or reasons, e.g. study of scenarios, the user might be interested to change the total demand in a region while maintaining the provided demand distribution of the default dataset. This is also useful for those who have regional data on a collective level rather than detailed building stock data. Feature 107 of Hotmaps toolbox is designed to facilitate this procedure for the user.
In the first step, the user selects his area of interest. Subsequently, the user can adapt the annual heat demand of the selected area. The corresponding calculation module is called and the given annual heat demand is distributed among 1ha pixels within the selected area. The share of each pixel from the total demand remains similar to the default heat density map. As an output, the updated version of heat density map for the selected area is generated.
